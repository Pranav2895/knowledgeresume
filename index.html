                    <p>As a developer I had always been inspired by the work done by the UX/UI designers. As it all
                        comes down to the design which is then executed later by the developer for the final project.

                    <p>Surfing through websites had always made me wonder how the things work , this is how I started
                        learning about the basic elements and the styling of the web.</p>

                    <p>HTML and CSS will do most of the things related to styling and adding content, but while surfing
                        the web, I went through a few things that were dynamic in nature. This is what motivated me to
                        start
                        learning the DOM(Document Object model).

                    <p>While ordering food or products from the web, I had always wondered how the data is being
                        manipulated for the needs of the customers.</p>

                    <p>Born in a house with a lab full of equipment and electronic gadgets, had inspired me to do a
                        hands on projects of my own. </p>

                    <p>Experience with electronics tinkering and hands on, made me think about projects that can add
                        convenience to my living. Costly home automation products made me find a cheap and a alternative
                        solution for a DIY Home Automation project of my own. </p>
